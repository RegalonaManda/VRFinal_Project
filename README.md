# VRFinal_Project

This project was developed for the third course of videogame production and design for the lecture of VR/AR. It was developed from scratch by Eric Regalon(developer), Xavi Alca√±iz (designer,writer) and Pau Vivas (developer).

The Kopfbrecher test consists of a simple game based on 5 minigames + a surprise at the end. During these tests there is an AI (CAIn) that will help (or not) the player to complete the tests.

## Controls

Left joystick: move

Right joystick: turn around and 180 degrees turn

Middle finger trigger: grab objects/pull bow string

Index finger trigger: shoot weapons

Be aware that this could be considered as an alpha so there are some minor bug fixes to be done.
